The interface is defined in the hash_table.h file. See the hash_table.c file for expected behavior and parameter descriptions.

main.c is the program to test it. Compile and run the code in main.c by running the following commands in the command line:

make main; ./main

Compile and run test through the commands:

make test; ./test

To benchmark your code to determine how efficient your implementation is, run the benchmark:

make benchmark; ./benchmark

To build everything, you can just type:

make
